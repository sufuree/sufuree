# Sufuree

A scale-to-zero runtime for applications and databases.

Sufuree is designed to start workloads when traffic arrives, route requests to
them, and release backend compute when it is no longer needed. The goal is to
make keeping many idle applications and database instances affordable, using
small isolated guests and demand-driven host autoscaling.

**Status: accepted architecture, not yet implemented.** This repository currently
contains the design RFCs. There is no runnable Sufuree CLI or runtime to install.
Performance, durability, provider behavior and cost savings still require
qualification.

## How it is designed to work

1. **Receive demand.** A small, always-on gateway accepts traffic and requests
   activation of a sleeping workload.
2. **Find capacity.** The controller places the workload on a suitable host,
   starting another host when admitted demand cannot fit.
3. **Start and route.** A host agent starts the isolated guest, verifies readiness
   and forwards traffic while tracking active work.
4. **Drain and scale down.** Idle workloads shut down safely. Empty backend hosts
   terminate after a quiet period, allowing the backend pool to reach zero.

The intended gateway and controller are written in Go and run on a qualified
unikernel. Workloads use unikernel guests where qualified, with Linux guests as
a compatibility fallback. The initial execution target is AWS with QEMU/KVM;
VM, bare-metal and provider differences remain explicit capability boundaries.

## Applications and databases

The design uses one repository, shared runtime packages and a single host-capacity
planner. Planned `sufuree app` and `sufuree db` command groups manage their
respective workload types.

- **Applications:** wake-on-demand routing, replica load balancing, optional
  session affinity, resource admission and safe draining.
- **Databases:** a SurrealDB-focused extension with persistent volume identity,
  single-writer fencing, engine-aware shutdown, backups and verified restoration.
- **Shared control:** declarative configuration, reconciliation, durable operation
  records, scoped infrastructure effects and lifecycle observability.

## What scale-to-zero means

The default target is zero **backend hosts** when no workload needs them. The
reachable gateway/controller, durable control state, retained data and backups
still incur costs.

Activation on a ready host targets seconds. Starting a new host can take minutes;
these are design targets, not measured guarantees. Optional warm capacity trades
cost for faster activation. Active transactions, streams and uncertain operations
can prevent safe shutdown. Sleeping a database does not delete its data.

## Design documents

| Document | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [RFC-0001: Scale-to-zero unikernel runtime](docs/rfc/0001-scale-to-zero-unikernel-runtime.md) | Shared architecture, application lifecycle, scheduling, networking, host scaling and recovery. |
| [RFC-0002: Scale-to-zero databases](docs/rfc/0002-scale-to-zero-databases.md) | Database lifecycle, storage custody, durability, backup and restore. |

These RFCs are the canonical design. Each records the qualification gates that
must pass before its behavior can be relied on, including crash recovery,
ownership enforcement, runtime compatibility and real cost measurements.
